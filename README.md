## **Architecture & Technologies**

### **Backend**

- **ASP.NET Core**  
   The backend is built using **ASP.NET Core**, a powerful, high-performance web framework for building APIs. It ensures scalability, security, and maintainability of the system.

- **Database: SQL**  
   The platform uses **SQL** for its relational database management system. PostgreSQL is reliable, highly scalable, and handles complex queries efficiently.

### **Frontend**

- **React with TypeScript**  
   The frontend is developed using **React** and **TypeScript** for a dynamic, responsive user interface. React allows us to build a single-page application (SPA) that provides an optimal experience for users, with fast page loads and a fluid interface.

## **Optional AI Integrations**

### **AI-Powered Features**

- **Price Prediction**  
   Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the price prediction model estimates the fair price of a property based on various factors like location, size, and market conditions. This can help buyers make informed decisions.

- **Recommendation Engine**  
   The recommendation engine uses machine learning to suggest properties to users based on their activity (clicks, favorites, searches). By analyzing user interactions, it provides personalized recommendations that are relevant and engaging.

- **AI Chatbot**  
   An AI chatbot that acts as an assistant for users, answering questions, providing market insights, and assisting with property-related queries.

- **Fraud Detection**  
   Leveraging AI, the fraud detection system will analyze the characteristics of listings and flag any suspicious or potentially fraudulent activity.
